# dotfiles

My real neat dotfiles, shared here for public perusal.

They are specialized for Fedora
[Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/) and
[Toolbox](https://github.com/containers/toolbox) containers with some
adaptations for [WSL](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL). User discretion is
advised üßê

I use GNU Stow to symlink these to the home directory. They expect zsh and tmux
to be installed (layered) on the host ostree and zsh, tmux, and Neovim to be
installed in toolboxes. [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) should also be
installed to the home directory at `~/.fzf`.

This repo is likely to be updated infrequently, if at all.
